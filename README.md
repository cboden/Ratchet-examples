## Vendor Support

Ratchet Examples comes with a lot of composer dependencies.  Here is a list of what each one's purpose is:

### AutobahnJS

[AutobahnJS](http://autobahn.ws/js) is the JavaScript library to be used in conjunction with the WAMPServerComponent. It provides an Pub/Sub and RPC sub-protocol on top of WebSockets. 

### When

[When](https://github.com/cujojs/when) is a JavaScript library required by AutobahnJS for deferred calls.

### web-socket-js

[A Flash polyfill for WebSockets](https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js).  Drop this in and if WebSockets aren't supported by the user's browser this library uses Flash to make the browser talk with your Ratchet app. 
Make sure, if using this library, to run a second Ratchet application using the FlashPolicyComponent.  Flash Sockets, before communicating in WebSockets, need pre-authorization. 

### Monolog

[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) is an feature rich, abstract logging library for PHP. It is used in one of the Cookbook source code examples.

### Guzzle

[Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org/) is a PHP library meant for abstracting cURL calls and working with RESTful APIs...Ratchet requires Guzzle to act as its HTTP server!

### Ratchet

Build your PHP WebSocket library!
